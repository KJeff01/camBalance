# camBalance
A modern take on the Warzone 2100 campaign balance while maintaining a familiar feel.

The goals of camBalance (short for "campaign rebalance") are to provide players the ability to play the game with a multitude of different strategies the original game lacked. It can be said that the 'S' in RTS is finally worthy of its definition for this beloved game in our community-involved rendition.

This repository also serves as a means to document almost all campaign script/stat changes for historical purposes. Without flooding the main Warzone 2100 repo with too much noise.
